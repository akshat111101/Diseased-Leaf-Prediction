# Diseased-Leaf-Prediction
Owing to changing climatic conditions, crops often get affected, as a result of which agricultural yield decreases drastically. If the condition gets worse, crops may get vulnerable towards infections caused by fungal, bacterial, virus, etc. diseases causing agents. The method that can be adopted to prevent plant loss can be carried out by real-time identification of plant diseases. Our proposed model provides an automatic method to determine leaf disease in a plant using a trained dataset of pomegranate leaf images. The test set is used to check whether an image entered into the system contains disease or not. If not, it is considered to be healthy, otherwise the disease if that leaf is predicted and the prevention of plant disease is proposed automatically. Further, the rodent causing disease is also identified with image analysis performed on the image certified by biologists and scientists. This model provides an accuracy of the results generated using different cluster sizes, optimized experimentally, with image segmentation. Our model provides useful estimation and prediction of disease causing agent with necessary precautions.
